## üöÄ Project Overview

**microservice-ecommerce** is designed to handle core aspects of an e-commerce system through loosely coupled microservices. The platform manages customers, products, orders, payments, and notifications with scalability and resilience in mind.

Key capabilities include:
- Modular microservices for independent deployment and scaling
- Real-time asynchronous communication using Kafka
- Centralized configuration management
- Secure authentication and authorization with Keycloak
- Observability via distributed tracing (Zipkin)
- Flexible data persistence strategies with MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Containerized deployment using Docker

### Domain Relationships Summary

- **Customer Domain:**  
  `Customer` (id, firstname, lastname, email) linked to multiple `Address` (id, street, houseNumber, zipCode).

- **Product Domain:**  
  `Product` (id, name, description, availableQuantity, price) linked to `Category` (id, name, description).

- **Order Domain:**  
  `Order` (id, orderDate, reference) linked to `OrderLine` (id, quantity), `Customer`, `Payment`, and `Notification`.

- **Payment Domain:**  
  `Payment` (id, reference, amount, status).

- **Notification Domain:**  
  `Notification` (id, sender, recipient, content, date).

---

## üèõ Architecture Overview

- **API Gateway:** Routes incoming requests to respective microservices (`/customers`, `/products`, `/orders`).  
- **Service Discovery:** Eureka Server manages dynamic registration and discovery of services.  
- **Event Streaming:** Kafka handles asynchronous communication for events such as payment and order confirmations.  
- **Distributed Tracing:** Zipkin monitors and traces requests across services.  
- **Databases:**  
  - MongoDB for flexible document-oriented data.  
  - PostgreSQL for structured, relational data.  
- **Configuration:** Centralized through Spring Cloud Config Server.

## üß∞ Project Structure

Each microservice is a standalone Spring Boot application responsible for a specific bounded context/domain, containerized via Docker, and communicating asynchronously through Kafka.

The main domains include:  
- Customer & Address  
- Product & Category  
- Order & OrderLine  
- Payment  
- Notification
